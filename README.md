It has two files of Dataset for training and testing as files are big we are not providing it with this but you can have it on ineuron site.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Backorders are unavoidable, but by anticipating which things will be backordered, planning can be streamlined at several levels, preventing unexpected strain on production, logistics, 
and transportation. ERP systems generate a lot of data (mainly structured) and also contain a lot of historical data; if this data can be properly utilized, a predictive model to forecast 
backorders and plan accordingly can be constructed. Based on past data from inventories, supply chain, and sales, classify the products as going into backorder (Yes or No).

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s 
          best fit for the above case.

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the backorder sales for a particular product according to the provided dataset.
